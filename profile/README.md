# CalculationCollective

## About

This is an organisation dedicated to making calculators in as many programming languages as possible.

## Definition of a Calculator

The following functionality must be given for a calculator to be valid.

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

Additionally for a calculator to be considered a working calculator the user needs to be able to input at least 2 numbers and receive the calculation result.
The calculation result also needs to be correct. (floating point inaccuracy is fine if according to [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754)) The calculator also needs to work with at least 1 decimal place both as input and output. It is important that every calculator includes the surce code of itself.

**EVAL IS NOT ALLOWED**
