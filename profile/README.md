## About

This is an organisation dedicated to making calculators in as many programming languages as possible.

## Definition of a Calculator

The following functionality must be given for a calculator to be valid.

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

Additionally for a calculator to be considered a working calculator the user needs to be able to input at least 2 numbers and receive the calculation result.
The calculation result also needs to be correct by regular mathematical standards. The calculator also needs to work with at least 1 decimal place both as input and output.
