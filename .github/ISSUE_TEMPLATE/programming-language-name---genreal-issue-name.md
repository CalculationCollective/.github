# Your issue is about adding a new language

### **What is the file ending for your programming language?**

We need this to create the repository for that language. (For Python that would be ".py" and the repository would be called "PYCalculator".)

### **Do you plan on writing the code for that calculator or are you simply suggesting a language?**

# Your issue is a general issue

### **Describe your issue**
